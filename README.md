# Exploring parts of the IOI circuit with sparse autoencoders (Neel Nanda MATS application)
[Research diary](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fLUjUzk5Bze8ZCqosTb31Inixv8KaV6hiHFscr36nJ0/edit)

The main file is `itsa_me_mainio.py`.

## Directories
The `autoencoders` dir is ~~stolen~~ borrowed from [Hoagy and Aidan's SAE paper repo](https://github.com/HoagyC/sparse_coding/tree/301a7cce582a2a38c3e8f8cd6a4054b1eb0df402).

The `models` dir contains the SAEs I'm working with (which I got from Hoagy).
